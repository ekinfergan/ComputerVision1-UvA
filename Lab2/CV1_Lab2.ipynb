The function, $h(k, l)$, is generally referred to as the neighborhood operator or local operator. One of the most common forms of a neighborhood operator is a linear filter. Linear filters simply compute the weighted sum of neighboring pixel intensities and assign it to the pixel of interest (output $I_{out}(i, j)$). The filters in which we are interested here are usually represented as a square matrix.\n","\n","---\n","**Hint**: Filters, kernels, weight matrices or masks are interchangeably used in the literature.

In the case of linear filters, this is simply multiplying each pixel intensity with the corresponding weight in the kernel (see the yellowish $7x7$ window where the kernel is placed). In the example, the kernel is $7x7$ averaging mask.
