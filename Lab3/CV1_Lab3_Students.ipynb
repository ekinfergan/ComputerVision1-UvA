Underlying optical flow is typically an assumption of $\\textit{brightness constancy}$. That is the image values (brightness, color, etc) remain constant over time, though their 2D position in the image may change. Algorithms for estimating optical flow exploit this assumption in various ways to compute a velocity field that describes the horizontal and vertical motion of every pixel in the image. For a 2D+t dimensional case a voxel at location $(x, y, t)$ with intensity $I(x, y, t)$ will have moved by $\\delta_x$, $\\delta_y$ and $\\delta_t$ between the two image frames, and the following image constraint equation can be given:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","I(x,y,t) = I(x+\\delta_x, y+\\delta_y, t+\\delta_t). \\tag{15}\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","Assuming the movement to be small, the image constraint at I(x, y, t) can be extended using Taylor series, truncated to first-order terms:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\tag{16}\n","I(x+\\delta_x, y+\\delta_y, t+\\delta_t) = I(x,y,t)+\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\delta_x +\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}\\delta_y+\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t}\\delta_t\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","Since we assume changes in the image can purely be attributed to movement, we will get:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\tag{17}\n","\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\delta_x}{\\delta_t} +   \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\delta_y}{\\delta_t} + \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\delta_t}{\\delta_t} = 0\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","or\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\tag{18}\n","I_x V_x + I_y V_y = -I_t,\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","where $V_x$ and $V_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity or optical flow of $I(x,y,t)$.

First, in image regions that are roughly homogeneous, the optical flow is ambiguous, because the brightness constancy assumption is satisfied by many different motions. Second, in real scenes, the assumption is violated at motion boundaries and by miscellaneous lighting, non-rigid motions, shadows, transparency, reflections, etc. To address the former, all optical flow methods make some sort of assumption about the spatial variation of the optical flow that is used to resolve the ambiguity. Those are just assumptions about the world which are approximate and consequently may lead to errors in the flow estimates. The latter problem can be addressed by making much richer but more complicated assumptions about the changing image brightness or, more commonly, using robust statistical methods which can deal with 'violations' of the brightness constancy assumption."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jT7t1MFHY3ik"},"source":["## Lucas-Kanade Algorithm"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iLgTbeQ8Y3ik"},"source":["We will be implementing the [Lucas-Kanade method](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub3/lucas_bruce_d_1981_2/lucas_bruce_d_1981_2.pdf) for Optical Flow estimation.
