When answering a question, give evidences (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, figures etc.) to support your arguments. Note that not everything might be explicitly asked for and you are expected to think about what might strengthen you arguments and make the notebook self-contained and complete.\n",

    "Optical flow is the apparent motion of image pixels or regions from one frame to the next, which results from moving objects in the image or from camera motion. Underlying optical flow is typically an assumption of $\\textit{brightness constancy}$. That is the image values (brightness, color, etc) remain constant over time, though their 2D position in the image may change. Algorithms for estimating optical flow exploit this assumption in various ways to compute a velocity field that describes the horizontal and vertical motion of every pixel in the image. For a 2D+t dimensional case a voxel at location $(x, y, t)$ with intensity $I(x, y, t)$ will have moved by $\\delta_x$, $\\delta_y$ and $\\delta_t$ between the two image frames, and the following image constraint equation can be given:\n",

    "Assuming the movement to be small, the image constraint at I(x, y, t) can be extended using Taylor series, truncated to first-order terms:\n",

    "\n",
    "Optical flow is difficult to compute for two main reasons. First, in image regions that are roughly homogeneous, the optical flow is ambiguous, because the brightness constancy assumption is satisfied by many different motions. Second, in real scenes, the assumption is violated at motion boundaries and by miscellaneous lighting, non-rigid motions, shadows, transparency, reflections, etc. To address the former, all optical flow methods make some sort of assumption about the spatial variation of the optical flow that is used to resolve the ambiguity. Those are just assumptions about the world which are approximate and consequently may lead to errors in the flow estimates. The latter problem can be addressed by making much richer but more complicated assumptions about the changing image brightness or, more commonly, using robust statistical methods which can deal with 'violations' of the brightness constancy assumption."
